# SVG LOGO Generator!!! (Module-10 ) 


## Description

Welcome to SVG Logo Generator! If you need a quick and simple logo for your projects, this is the place! I am using Node.js to generate an SVG file based on your input, so you get a custom logo without needing a graphic designer.

Itâ€™s built using JavaScript and runs in the command line, where you can enter your own text (up to 3 characters), choose a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and pick colors for both the text and shape. Once you input your choices, an SVG file is created instantly with your custom logo.

So go ahead, run the app, enter your details, and get your logo in seconds! 




## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for text

THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for the text color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I am prompted for a shape

THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts

THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
